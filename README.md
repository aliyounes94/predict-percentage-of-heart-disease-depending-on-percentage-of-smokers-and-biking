## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts the **percentage of heart disease prevalence** in a population using two key lifestyle factors:  
- **Percentage of smokers**  
- **Percentage of people who bike regularly**  

Built with Python and machine learning, this tool helps public health professionals analyze how smoking and physical activity (via biking) may correlate with heart disease risk.
